NEXT STEPS:

Call Metadatastore Readfile(f)

Create a set of hashed blocks...
Read bytes from file into 4KB chunks, with last chunk at least 1KB.
Convert bytes into hashes
Send hashes along to Metadata store?


HIGH-LEVEL NEXT STEP(s):
Upload a file to metadatastore


Upload a file
* DONE Reads the local file
* WIP (Currently one hash block) creates a set of hashed blocks
* uploads them onto the MetadataStore 
* uploads them onto the BlockStore (if they were not already present there).
* When a client wants to create a new file, it first contacts the MetadataStore leader to see if the file already exists (or existed in the past, and has since been deleted).
* If the file already exists, it notes the previous version number, otherwise the file will start with a default version of 0.
* The client then reads its local copy of the file and splits it into blocks, as described above.
* It then computes the hash values of each of the blocks to form a hashlist.
* It then contacts the MetadataStore leader and invokes the ModifyFile() API, passing it the filename, updated version number, and hashlist.
* ModifyFile should only be applied when the given version number is exactly one higher than the version stored in the metadatastore.

Clients are also responsible for uploading the blocks of the file to the BlockStore service.
What if another client tries to download a file using the hashlist given to ModifyFile() by the first client to the MetadataStore before it’s done uploading all of the blocks to the BlockStore? 
How can SurfStore guarantee that a client actually did upload the necessary blocks for the file, and didn’t crash along the way?
* When the client does a ModifyFile() operation, the MetadataStore leader is going to query the BlockStore for each of the hash values in the hashlist, to see which, if any, of the blocks are already in the BlockStore.
* If any blocks are missing from the BlockStore, the MetadataStore will reply back to the client with a list of missing blocks. 
* The MetadataStore will not create the filename to hashlist mapping if any blocks are not present in the BlockStore. 
* Only when all the blocks are in the BlockStore will the MetadataStore signal a success return value to the client’s ModifyFile() operation
* From then on the new file version is available to any clients that want to download it.

Usage:
$ client myconfig.txt upload /path/to/file
Ex:
$ client /etc/myconfig.txt upload /home/aturing/myfile.txt
OK
